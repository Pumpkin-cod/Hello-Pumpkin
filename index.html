    <body>
        <p2>Dear Eileen,</p2> <br /> <br />
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's 
            Science faculty to study as part <br />of your PHD next year. I will answer your 
            questions one by one, in the following sections:

        <h3>Starting Dates</h3>
        <p2>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us anytime, however it will suit us better if you <br />
        could start at the beginning of a semester:the start dates for each one are as follows:</p2>

        <ul>
            <li>First Semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second Semester:15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third Semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p2>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br /> <br />
         You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p2>

         <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
         <p2>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded facility - as long as the subjects fall
        <br />somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        <br />the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
        <br />by are as follows,in order of priority: 
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effects on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F), when the 
                <br />audience size exponentially increases  (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
           
            <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
         </p2>So please can you provide moe information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br />
         research to take, required staff and other resources, and aything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p2>Yes, you are right!As part of my post-doctorate work,I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question <br />
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p2> <br /> <br />

        Polynesian chicken dance <br /> 
            A little known but <em>very</em> influrntial dance dating back as far back as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br />
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestockes to be "fruitful". <br />        
        Icelandic brownian dance <br />
            Before Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br />
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br />
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br />
            modern styles such as Twerking. <br />
        Arctic robot dance <br />
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br />
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br />
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were moving  like this <br />
            because they were really cold. <br /> <br />
            
        <p2> For more of my research, see my <a href="http://example.com">exotic dance reserch page</a> <br /> <br />
             Yours Sincerely, <br /> <br />
